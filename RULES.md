Chemistry Chard Game

This game is played with 2-10 players.

This game is played with a deck of 103 cards, one for every element of the periodic table from Hydrogen (atomic number 1) to Lawrencium (atomic number 103).

Depending on the number of players, remove cards from the deck before starting according to the table below. Include only cards with atomic number of Deck Size or below. Then deal out an equal number of cards to each player (this initial hand size is included in the table for convenience). Set the leftover cards aside: they will not be used in this game.

| Players   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  |
| --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Deck Size | 36  | 54  | 54  | 54  | 86  | 103 | 103 | 103 | 103 |
| Hand Size | 15  | 15  | 13  | 10  | 14  | 14  | 12  | 11  | 10  |

Each player privately selects a card from their hand to draft. Once all players have made their selection, they place the drafted card face up in front of them. Then, they pass the remaining cards to the left. The process repeats until all of the cards have been drafted.

The goal of the game is to score the most points. Scoring is as follows:

- **Atomic number**: Players earn points equal to the square of the longest sequence of consecutive atomic numbers they have drafted, with a minimum length of 2 and up to a maximum length of 4. For example, if a player has atomic numbers 1, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, and 13, they would score 9 points for their longest sequence of 3: 5, 6, and 7.
  - | Elements | 2   | 3   | 4   |
    | -------- | --- | --- | --- |
    | Points   | 4   | 9   | 16  |
- **Atomic mass**: Add up the atomic mass of all of your drafted cards. Then, compare your total atomic mass to each of your neighbors', that is, the players sitting on your left and right. For each where your atomic mass is greater, you score 2 points. For each where your atomic mass is lower, you lose 2 points. (In a 2-player game, the player with the larger atomic mass would gain 4 points and the player with the lower atomic mass would lose 4 points.) No points are awarded or taken away for ties.
- **Atomic symbol**: The first player to spell a 5-letter word with their atomic symbols scores 8 points. The second player scores 5, and the third player scores 2. If two players both spell a 5-letter word on the same turn, they each get the points for that placing, and the next place is skipped for scoring. For example, if Barry and Suzy tie to be the first to spell a 5-letter word on turn 4, then they each score 8 points. If you then spell a 5-letter word on turn 5, you score 2 points for 3rd place.
- **Ionization**: Score 5 points for each matching pair of positive and negative ions with the same number of charges. Each element can only be used in one pair.
- **Family**: Count the number of elements you have in unique families, and the number of elements you have in your largest family. Whichever number is greater, up to a maximum of 6, you score points as follows:
  - | Elements | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |
    | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | Points   | 1   | 3   | 6   | 10  | 15  |
- **Radioactivity (7+ players only)**: If you have at least 2 radioactive elements, you score 7 points. However, if you have exactly 1, you lose 3 points.

The player with the most total points wins. If there is a tie, the player who drafted the element with the highest atomic number wins.
